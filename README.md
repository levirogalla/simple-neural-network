# Simple neural network

This project provides functions and classes to create a deep neural network.

## To use

Import either nnv1 or nnv2 from network and pass a tuple defining the network structure as well as the random weight range and activation function.

Call train function to iteratavly update parameters.

## To Do

Improve documentation.
